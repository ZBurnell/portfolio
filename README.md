# ZBurnell Professional Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to the Repo for the first Webpage I have created from Scratch. There were a lot of problems I ran into along the way, but over all it came together in a coheasive webpage. In the future I plan to clean up the code and add more projects. I expect this to evolve over time with my skills. This portfolio is a good start for me to build on as I continue my journey into becomming a full stack developer.

## Acknowledgment
Portfolio was built using all of the tools and knowledge I've gained through the OSU Full Stack Development boot camp. I took some inspiration from [ForrestKnight's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fknight) and added my own spin and style. On top of that there were a lot of W3 Schools and StackOverflow documents that were refrenced along the way.
