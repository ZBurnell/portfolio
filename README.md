# Description
Welcome to the Repo for the first Webpage I have created from Scratch. There were a lot of problems I ran into along the way, but over all it came together in a coheasive webpage. In the future I plan to clean up the code and add more projects. I expect this to evolve over time with my skills. This portfolio is a good start for me to build on as I continue my journey into becomming a full stack developer.
